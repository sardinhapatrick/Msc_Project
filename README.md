# A Declarative Approach to Graphic Programming

The idea of this project is to facilitate the creation of code for graphical programming using a new language named PATL. This is a Swift oriented DSL based on a completely declarative language: React. PATL is a declarative overlay to [Rendery](https://github.com/RenderyEngine/Rendery) and give us a higher level of abstraction for graphical programming. To build a PATL program, a standard library is provided. This library allows to get sequences of Rendery statements from PATL statements in order to obtain the wanted graphical representation.
